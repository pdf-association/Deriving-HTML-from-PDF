The repository is for PDF Association members of the [Responsive-PDF TWG](https://www.pdfa.org/community/responsivepdf-technical-working-group/) and [PDF Reuse TWG](https://www.pdfa.org/community/pdf-reuse-twg/) technical working groups to track work on updates to the document describing the algorithm for deriving HTML from well-tagged PDF 2.0 (as defined by [ISO 32000-2:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html)).

The [PDF Association](https://www.pdfa.org) published version 1.0 of [Deriving HTML from PDF: A usage specification for tagged ISO 32000-2 files](https://www.pdfa.org/resource/deriving-html-from-pdf/) in June 2019.

Through the Issues feature on this repository we collect feedback and manage updates to the document. Version 1.1 is currently in development by the TWGs.
